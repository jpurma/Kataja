FIX:

+ Better add-triangle buttons (make them touchareas)
+ Draw better triangles
    + Improved them quite a lot
    + fading locks appear for hidden nodes too, in their old places. And it looks like
    viewport resize is also counting hidden nodes
    + Triangled label width is wrong
+ Fix rare add branch -bug, that creates a node that is not recognized by visualization algorithm.
    + add to top right into new tree creates problem -- Fixed
    + Rare children who aren't in tree
        + maybe fixed already, could be caused by set grid overwriting nodes
+ Fix situation where tree is replaced as new node is added on top.
- Fix parsing of currently broken trees and those that create too many Tree -objects.
    + Too many trees -problem is fixed

+ Replace fade in Movable with QAnimation
+ Make all Movables to use QGraphicsObject (to support QAnimation)
- Use fade for mouseover rectangles
- Comments should keep their relative locations to nodes when visualization changes.
+ New branches don't always follow position adjustments of their parents.
    + Adjusting previously adjusted nodes behaves weirdly
+ Triangling an element makes it lose its adjustment
+ Opening a triangle leaves the label visible when it shouldn't
+ dragging in Linearized static trees doesn't store the position
+ Edges and Nodes overlap or are too close in LeftFirstTree visualization
    - Trees are not really considered in LeftFirstTree algorithm
+ Edge shape changing is broken
+ When unfolding triangle containing another triangle, some edges from the contained triangle
become visible
+ Fixed printing in Windows
+ Nodes jump into strange places in folding animations
    - Some rare version of this bug is still there
+ Splash screen transparency is broken
+ Traces are visible when they shouldn't
    + Trace indices are missing
    + Multidomination / traces switch is working again
+ Some buttons get their trigger argument instead of sender and crash
+ Dynamic width visualizations are quite unable to look nice
    + LinearizedStaticTree creates unnecessary traces
    + Triangles behave oddly in Dynamic width trees
+ Deleting node causes broken chain error
+ Highlighter not visible in LeftFirstTree or LinearizedDynamic. Strange!
+ LeftFirstHexTree sometimes draws very long branches
    + Refactored LeftFirstHexTree to SpirallingTree
    - Branch start points are ugly for many visualisations
+ Scope selection box in drawing styles is too narrow
- Line shape selector doesn't update when changing forests.
- Second fat edge shape is missing an icon
+ Loading fails
    + Trees are not restored
    + Ghosting glosses
    + Broken projection chain when changing forest
    + Missing aliases
    + Zoom level is miscalculated
    -W Some item is added twice to scene
+ Embedded menus start in wrong places and fade and slide into place
+ New nodes are not properly counted in into visualization algorithm, probably Tree problem.
+ Add sibling fails to remove tree from merged node
+ Lack of headedness makes stupid parse too stupid
+ Fixed action arguments
+ Adding a gloss crashes embed edit
    - gloss exists both as a separate node and a line in label
+ Various tree identity problems in complex operations
+ Keyboard movement crashes
    + Crashes on edges
- Icon for opening additional panels has 'close this panel' for tooltip
+ New node edit box doesn't stretch for longer texts
    + New node edit box title doesn't follow its purpose
+ New node edit box assumes attempt to draw arrow if scale is small or changed enough when the
edit box is open (two end points move).
+ Embeds get focus on creation but lose it immediately.
+ Clicking top nodes is often impossible as toucharea hitboxes cover the node.
- Very long node labels break visualizations:
    - SpirallingTree, maximum recursion depth
    - LeftFirstTree, setting trees side by side
+ Creating comment with NewElementEmbed leaves the comment text empty
    + NotImplementedError: QGraphicsObject.paint() is abstract and must be overridden
    + Textarea in comment editing updates/paints poorly
+ Node info shows coordinates relative to tree, not to scene
+ Save without user selection doesn't work in sandboxed app
+ Print image without user selection doesn't work in sandboxed app
- Group overlap algorithm should be improved

ADD:

- Add visualization specific settings to visualization panel
- Shift-drag to move nodes instead of copying
+ Rotation of node magnets depending on visualization
+ PreferencesDialog
    - Missing some complex settings
+ Automated test for loading and saving
+ New Forest
- New Treeset
+ Stupid parse for new trees
- Tee-shaped edge
+ Support for larger UI font
    + Panels resize properly
    + Preference option for large UI
+ Dragging a symbol creates a node
+ Dragging text creates a tree
+ Button for reset to default preferences
- Copying and pasting nodes and trees
- Button to remove adjustments for node
+ Symbol table can be resized when floating
+ Amoeba-like selection
    + More transparent colors for selections
    + Embed panel for naming the selection and giving a color for it
    + Data structure for named groups
    + How to deal with children and overlapping groups?
    + Display group names
