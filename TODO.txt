- Add visualization specific settings to visualization panel
+ Better add-triangle buttons (make them touchareas)
- Draw better triangles
- Fix rare add branch -bug, that creates a node that is not recognized by visualization algorithm.
    + add to top right into new tree creates problem -- Fixed
    - Rare children who aren't in tree
        = maybe fixed already, could be caused by set grid overwriting nodes
+ Fix situation where tree is replaced as new node is added on top.
- Fix parsing of currently broken trees and those that create too many Tree -objects.
+ Replace fade in Movable with QAnimation
+ Make all Movables to use QGraphicsObject (to support QAnimation)
- Use fade for mouseover rectangles
- Comments should keep their relative locations to nodes when visualization changes.
+ New branches don't always follow position adjustments of their parents.
    - Adjusting previously adjusted nodes behaves weirdly
+ Triangling an element makes it lose its adjustment
+ Opening a triangle leaves the label visible when it shouldn't
