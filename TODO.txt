- Add visualization specific settings to visualization panel
+ Better add-triangle buttons (make them touchareas)
+ Draw better triangles
    + Improved them quite a lot
    + fading locks appear for hidden nodes too, in their old places. And it looks like
    viewport resize is also counting hidden nodes
- Fix rare add branch -bug, that creates a node that is not recognized by visualization algorithm.
    + add to top right into new tree creates problem -- Fixed
    - Rare children who aren't in tree
        = maybe fixed already, could be caused by set grid overwriting nodes
+ Fix situation where tree is replaced as new node is added on top.
- Fix parsing of currently broken trees and those that create too many Tree -objects.
+ Replace fade in Movable with QAnimation
+ Make all Movables to use QGraphicsObject (to support QAnimation)
- Use fade for mouseover rectangles
- Comments should keep their relative locations to nodes when visualization changes.
+ New branches don't always follow position adjustments of their parents.
    + Adjusting previously adjusted nodes behaves weirdly
+ Triangling an element makes it lose its adjustment
+ Opening a triangle leaves the label visible when it shouldn't
+ dragging in Linearized static trees doesn't store the position
- Edges and Nodes overlap or are too close in LeftFirstTree visualization
+ Edge shape changing is broken
+ When unfolding triangle containing another triangle, some edges from the contained triangle
become visible
+ Fixed printing in Windows
+ Nodes jump into strange places in folding animations
    - Some rare version of this bug is still there
+ Splash screen transparency is broken
