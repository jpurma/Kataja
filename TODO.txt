FIX:

+ Better add-triangle buttons (make them touchareas)
+ Draw better triangles
    + Improved them quite a lot
    + fading locks appear for hidden nodes too, in their old places. And it looks like
    viewport resize is also counting hidden nodes
+ Fix rare add branch -bug, that creates a node that is not recognized by visualization algorithm.
    + add to top right into new tree creates problem -- Fixed
    + Rare children who aren't in tree
        + maybe fixed already, could be caused by set grid overwriting nodes
+ Fix situation where tree is replaced as new node is added on top.
- Fix parsing of currently broken trees and those that create too many Tree -objects.
    + Too many trees -problem is fixed

+ Replace fade in Movable with QAnimation
+ Make all Movables to use QGraphicsObject (to support QAnimation)
- Use fade for mouseover rectangles
- Comments should keep their relative locations to nodes when visualization changes.
+ New branches don't always follow position adjustments of their parents.
    + Adjusting previously adjusted nodes behaves weirdly
+ Triangling an element makes it lose its adjustment
+ Opening a triangle leaves the label visible when it shouldn't
+ dragging in Linearized static trees doesn't store the position
- Edges and Nodes overlap or are too close in LeftFirstTree visualization
+ Edge shape changing is broken
+ When unfolding triangle containing another triangle, some edges from the contained triangle
become visible
+ Fixed printing in Windows
+ Nodes jump into strange places in folding animations
    - Some rare version of this bug is still there
+ Splash screen transparency is broken
+ Traces are visible when they shouldn't
    + Trace indices are missing
    + Multidomination / traces switch is working again
+ Some buttons get their trigger argument instead of sender and crash
+ Dynamic width visualizations are quite unable to look nice
    + LinearizedStaticTree creates unnecessary traces
    + Triangles behave oddly in Dynamic width trees
+ Deleting node causes broken chain error
+ Highlighter not visible in LeftFirstTree or LinearizedDynamic. Strange!
+ LeftFirstHexTree sometimes draws very long branches
    + Refactored LeftFirstHexTree to SpirallingTree
    - Branch start points are ugly for many visualisations
- Scope selection box in drawing styles is too narrow
- Line shape selector doesn't update when changing forests.
- Second fat edge shape is missing icon
+ Loading fails
    + Trees are not restored
    + Ghosting glosses
    + Broken projection chain when changing forest
    + Missing aliases
    + Zoom level is miscalculated

ADD:

- Add visualization specific settings to visualization panel
- Shift-drag to move nodes instead of copying
- Rotation of node magnets depending on visualization
- PreferencesDialog
- Automated test for loading and saving
