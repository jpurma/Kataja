Kataja is a free and open software for visualising hypothetical syntactic structures in minimalist and biolinguistic frameworks. Most of the current models in generative theory assume few basic operations cyclically applied and thus create quite complex structures. Kataja aims to help in manipulating and evaluating these. 

## Drawing

Kataja lets you draw trees quickly and in free order. Kataja drawing interface enforces binary trees, but it can be fed with unary and n-branching trees. Nodes can be edited in place and new siblings can be added with a single click on a "sprout". 

{% include image name="new.png" width="40%" %}

Features can be added on any node, and features can be shared by many constituents. 

Kataja is especially strong with multidominated structures: nodes can be dragged under new parents and there are many animated options for visualising such graphs. Best of all, Kataja trees can be exported with single click as publication quality cropped, resolution independent PDF drawings or PNG images: 

{% include image name="beta.png" width="60%" caption="Here the leftmost β is dominated by both α and β" %}

## Presenting

Kataja can be used in presentations or lectures, live in location, or streamed or recorded from your desktop. 

Each Kataja file is a set of 'slides', independent trees or groups of them. Everything done with the trees creates a visual response or animation, to help the audience to follow what has happened. Kataja even has a facecam widget to ease setting up recording or streaming.

Kataja is free and for everyone: the audience can have the same tool as the lecturer and look at the examples own their own.

## Experimenting

Kataja has a plugin system for developing and running syntactic models in Python, as complex as they get. In these cases Kataja is a visualisation framework: plugin sends derivation steps, or intermediate states and Kataja provides means to browse and visualise them.
