Kataja
======

Visualizing Biolinguistics

Kataja is an open source visualization framework for researchers working with syntax of human languages. 
Kataja aims to be the best available tool for:

 - **DRAWING** syntactic trees
 - **PRESENTING** syntactic phenomena
 - **CRAFTING** syntactic hypotheses

The features will be added to satisfy these needs, in this order.

Kataja is designed and developed by Jukka Purma and it is published under GPL3 license. See COPYING.
The work here is the production part for PhD (Doctor of Arts) in Aalto University School of Art, Design and Architecture, supervised by doc. Pauli Brattico (University of Helsinki) and prof. Teemu Leinonen (Aalto ARTS). 

Kataja is built on Qt5.3 and Python3.4, using Riverbank Software's PyQt5 to provide Qt bridge for Python.


Current version
---------------

The software is pre-alpha, under development. Daily updates may break features, and generally are not made in order to publish new features, but to help express and maintain the daily progress with the code base.  

Running and installing
----------------------

The software can be run as a python program in environments where Python 3.4+, PyQt5.3+ and Qt5.3 are to be found.
  
Standalone apps for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux will be provided when the software is in stage where it is usable.

Development roadmap
-------------------

Dec 2014: Alpha -- Drawing features, including loading, saving, undo, preferences and printing as pdf are stable enough for use.
Builds for OS X, Windows and Linux.

May 2015: Beta1 -- Presenation features, step-by-step derivation and improvements on drawing.

September 2015: Beta2 -- Crafting features: API for making derivation rules, interface for feature and lexicon creation and running derivations for given input files.
