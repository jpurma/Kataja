Visualizing Biolinguistics


Kataja is an open source visualization framework for researchers working with syntax of human languages. You can use it to 

1) draw print quality constituent trees for publications, to 
2) demonstrate operations with constituent structures in presentations or in teaching and to 
3) test and prototype your own syntax models.
