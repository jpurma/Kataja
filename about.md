Kataja visualisation tool is developed by [Jukka Purma](http://purma.fi) as part of Doctor of Arts thesis in [Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture](http://arts.aalto.fi/en/). Thanks for [Media Lab](https://medialab.aalto.fi) and especially [LeGroup](http://legroup.aalto.fi) for providing an inspiring research environment.

Kataja development has also been supported and supervised by [Pauli Brattico](https://finnishsyntax.wordpress.com), Saara Huhmarniemi, Tommi Gr√∂ndahl and Taija Saikkonen -- our multiyear ongoing linguistics seminar from [Cognitive Science](http://www.helsinki.fi/kognitiotiede/english/index.htm) at [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en). 

This site is powered by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), using a heavily modified [Hyde-theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com) from [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There is a hidden option to use Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized colors](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) in this web site, and Kataja really benefits from them. Kataja also uses Apostolos Syropoulos' [Asana Math Font](
http://www.ctan.org/pkg/asana-math).
