If you use Kataja in your research, either as an analysis tool or to present your analysis, you should consider referring to the thesis that describes your instrument: 

<div class="message">
    Purma, J. (2016) Kataja - Visualising biolinguistics.
</div>

This page will collect references to research that uses or acknowledges Kataja. Please [notify me](mailto:jukka.purma@aalto.fi) if you want a reference to be added to this list.

Since Kataja is free, references and recognition is what motivates its further development.
